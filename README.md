# 05 Third Party APIs: Day Planner

## Workday Planner

This application displays time blocks for each hour from 8AM to 5PM for one day. The user can click in the text area for the hour and begin entering text. When they enter text, the save button changes color to indicate that there are unsaved changes. When the save button is clicked, the button reverts to the normal appearance and the users info is stored in a specific array index in local storage. Additionally, moment.js was used to style the time blocks to indicate whether the block was in the past, present (current hour), or future.
